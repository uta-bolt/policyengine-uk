## Install Instructions for Users and Contributors

This package requires [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/). More recent versions should work, but are not tested.

All platforms that can execute Python are supported, which includes GNU/Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows (in which case we recommend using [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) instead of the default console).

### Setting-up a Virtual Environment with Pew

In order to limit dependencies conflicts, we recommend to use a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (abbreviated as “virtualenv”) with a virtualenv manager such as [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew).

- A [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a project specific environment created to suit the needs of the project you are working on.
- A virtualenv manager such as [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) lets you easily create, remove and toggle between several virtualenvs.

To install pew, launch a terminal on your computer and follow these instructions:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pew  # if asked, answer "Y" to the question about modifying your shell config file.
pew new openfisca --python=python3.7  # create a new virtualenv called “openfisca”
```

The virtualenv you just created will be automatically activated. This means you will operate in the virtualenv immediately. You should see a prompt resembling this:

```
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl+D' to return.
```

You can re-activate that virtualenv at any time with `pew workon openfisca`.

:tada: You are now ready to install this OpenFisca Country Package!

Two install procedures are available. Pick procedure A or B below depending on how you plan to use this Country Package.

### A. Minimal Installation (Pip Install)

Follow this installation if you wish to:
- run calculations on a large population;
- create tax & benefits simulations;
- write an extension to this legislation (e.g. city specific tax & benefits);
- serve your Country Package with the OpenFisca Web API.

For more advanced uses, head to the [Advanced Installation](#advanced-installation-git-clone).

#### Install this Country Package with Pip Install

Inside your virtualenv, check the prerequisites:

```sh
python --version  # should print "Python 2.7.xx".
#if not, make sure you pass the python version as an argument when creating your virtualenv
```

```sh
pip --version  # should print at least 9.0.
#if not, run "pip install --upgrade pip"
```
Install the Country Package:

```sh
pip install openfisca_uk
```

:tada: This OpenFisca Country Package is now installed and ready!

#### Next Steps

- To learn how to use OpenFisca, follow our [tutorials](https://openfisca.org/doc/).
- To serve this Country Package, serve the [OpenFisca web API](#serve-your-country-package-with-the-openFisca-web-api).

Depending on what you want to do with OpenFisca, you may want to install yet other packages in your virtualenv:
- To install extensions or write on top of this Country Package, head to the [Extensions documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/contribute/extensions.html).
- To plot simulation results, try [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).
- To manage data, check out [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

#### Clone this Country Package with Git

First of all, make sure [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) is installed on your machine.

Set your working directory to the location where you want this OpenFisca Country Package cloned.

Inside your virtualenv, check the prerequisites:

```sh
python --version  # should print "Python 2.7.xx".
#if not, make sure you pass the python version as an argument when creating your virtualenv
```

```sh
pip --version  # should print at least 9.0.
#if not, run "pip install --upgrade pip"
```
Clone this Country Package on your machine:

## Serve this Country Package with the OpenFisca Web API

If you are considering building a web application, you can use the packaged OpenFisca Web API with your Country Package.

To serve the Openfisca Web API locally, run:

```sh
openfisca serve --port 5000
```

Or use the quick-start Make command:

```
make serve-local
```

To read more about the `openfisca serve` command, check out its [documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/openfisca-python-api/openfisca_serve.html).

You can make sure that your instance of the API is working by requesting:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:5000/spec"
```

This endpoint returns the [Open API specification](https://www.openapis.org/) of your API.

:tada: This OpenFisca Country Package is now served by the OpenFisca Web API! To learn more, go to the [OpenFisca Web API documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/openfisca-web-api/index.html).

You can test your new Web API by sending it example JSON data located in the `situation_examples` folder.

Substitute your package's country name for `openfisca_uk` below:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @./openfisca_uk/situation_examples/couple.json \
  http://localhost:5000/calculate
```
