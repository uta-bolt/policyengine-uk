    "## Program description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The program provides free childcare hours based on the child's age:\n",
    "* Children aged **9 months to 2 years** receive **15 hours** of free childcare per week\n",
    "* Children aged **3 to 4 years** receive **30 hours** of free childcare per week\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work status\n",
    "Eligible individuals must be either employed or about to start employment. This includes those on qualifying leave types: **sick**, **annual**, **shared parental**, **maternity**, **paternity**, or **adoption** leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-working partners may qualify if they receive: **incapacity benefit**, **severe disablement allowance**, **carer's allowance**, **limited capability for work benefit**, or **contribution-based employment and support allowance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income requirements\n",
    "Minimum earnings thresholds (per **3 months**) vary by age:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Age group | Minimum earnings | Weekly equivalent |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **21+** | **£2,380** | **£183** |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Additional rules\n",

    "#### Income assessment\n",
    "The program offers flexible income assessment:\n",
    "* Combines **multiple income sources**\n",
    "* Allows **annual income averaging**\n",
    "* Gives **self-employed** individuals choice between total or self-employment income\n",
