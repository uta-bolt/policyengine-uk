    "\n",
    "* I want to simulate policy over specific households.\n",
    "* I want to run microsimulation analyses over large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can do the former in a few minutes of setup, but the UK's large household surveys are only available to academics, researchers and nonprofits, so getting set up takes a bit longer (and you should [get in touch](https://policyengine.org/uk/contact) so we can make it as fast as possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can, please use Google Colab. It's free, and more importantly, it enables everyone to use the same computing environment, saving all the trouble of fiddling around with bad Python installations, etc. It means that the below snippet is all you need to use the full microsimulation model:\n",
