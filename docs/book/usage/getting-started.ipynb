    "Anyone can do the former in a few minutes of setup, but the UK's large household surveys are only available to academics, researchers and nonprofits, so getting set up takes a bit longer (and you should [get in touch](https://policyengine.org/uk/contact) so we can make it as fast as possible).\n",
