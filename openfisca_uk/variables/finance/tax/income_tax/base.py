The calculation of income tax is specified by the Income Tax Act 2007 s. 23
which outlines the main steps. Step 1 indicates that the components of 'total income'
should be added together, but the Act itself does not specify what those components are.
Instead, other Acts (the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and the Income Tax 
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005) impose the charges to income tax on each component of
income. The relevant sections of each act imposing charges to income tax are given 
for each component of income below. The components are guided by the article at
