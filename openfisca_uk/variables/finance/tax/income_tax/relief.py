"""
These variables calculate the tax reliefs that a taxpayer is eligible for, following the Income Tax Act (2007) s. 23.
Tax reliefs are amounts to be deducted from the assessed total income of a person.
The section detailing some tax reliefs applicable is section 24 of the Act, but others are described in the 2003 and 2005 Acts as deductions from the respective components.
Not all reliefs are calculated here - only the major ones.
